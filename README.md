# Realtime-Gender-Detection-using-python  
There are many libraries and frameworks in Python that can be used to create a real-time gender detection system. Some of these libraries include Yolo, Tensorflow, OpenCV, and Cvlib. So here I am going to use the Cvlib library in Python that can be used to detect the gender of a person in a few lines of code.

Along with Cvlib, I will also be using the OpenCV library in Python so that we can detect a personâ€™s gender using a webcam. So here is how to install both libraries on your system using the pip command:

pip install opencv-python
pip install cvlib
